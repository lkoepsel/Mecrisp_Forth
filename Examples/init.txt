\ Using the INIT word for turnkey applications, an example by t.Porter 2016
\
\ If a word named INIT is found in the Dictionary at boot, the contents will be executed.
\ Note, if INIT is a closed loop with no method to exit the loop such as KEY?, reflashing the MCU will be required to alter the program.

\ METHOD:
\ Create a INIT word which prints a short message and save it to Flash

compiletoflash
: INIT cr ." init-1 run at bootup " cr ;
compiletoram

\ rebooting the MCU will print the message "init-1 run at bootup" as intended. But what if you want to add something to the bootup later on, and still want the first INIT to be used ?

\ This is easily done, but the executable location of the first INIT word above must be found (note the value will probably be different for you on a different system)


\ run "words" and look for the init word at the base of the list,  use "Code: XXXXXXXX" in this case 0000404C  <--NOTE !! DON'T USE THIS, USE YOURS!

\ now create another init word and call the previous INIT word with 'EXECUTE". Don't forget to add a leading "$" as this is a HEX value. This can be done
\ as many times as required with multiple INIT's

compiletoflash
: INIT cr ." init-2 run at bootup " cr $0000404C EXECUTE cr ;
compiletoram


\ rebooting should print :-
\ init-2 run at bootup
\ init-1 run at bootup
